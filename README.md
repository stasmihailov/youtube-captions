A simple app which pulls autogenerated captions from YouTube videos, so that I could read them and decide if those videos are worth watching. This app is probably an overkill, but I'm a software engineer, so that's a given

Can't believe that I spend 3 hours on building this, just to find out that https://youtubecc.sm-seo.com/ already exists
